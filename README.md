Project Title: Stirred Reactor Design and Optimization (Internship Report)
Challenge: The internship at Seprex Pvt. Ltd. presented the challenge of bridging the gap between theoretical chemical engineering knowledge and practical industrial application. The primary focus was on the design and optimization of stirred tank reactors, critical units in chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing. The goal was to understand how key design parameters impact performance, cost, and energy efficiency.
Methodology:
1.	Fundamental Analysis: The project began with a deep dive into the core principles of stirred reactor systems. I used the power number (Np) and Reynolds number (Re) to perform quantitative analysis of reactor performance, power consumption, and flow regimes. This included applying the Power Equation (P=Np⋅ρ⋅N3⋅D5) to various impeller geometries and operational speeds.
2.	Parameter Optimization: A key part of the work involved analyzing how different design choices affect mixing efficiency. I investigated the influence of baffle configuration (number, width, and clearance), impeller type (Rushton, pitched-blade, hydrofoil), and tank geometry on fluid flow patterns. This analysis was crucial for identifying design trade-offs that maximize mixing while minimizing energy consumption.
3.	Comparative Equipment Evaluation: I performed a comparative study of different reactor types, including standard stirred tanks, jacketed reactors, and pressurized vessels. The evaluation was based on a criteria set that included thermal management capabilities, pressure ratings, material compatibility, and fabrication costs.
4.	Economic Integration: The project incorporated an essential business aspect: cost estimation. I learned to conduct preliminary cost analyses for reactor setups, making design decisions that accounted for economic constraints alongside technical feasibility.
Results and Impact:
•	Enhanced Design Competence: Through detailed calculations and analysis, the internship provided a robust understanding of how to select and design reactor systems based on specific process requirements, moving beyond theoretical knowledge to practical application.
•	Optimized Energy Efficiency: The project demonstrated a clear link between impeller and baffle design and energy consumption, showcasing how to optimize a reactor's geometry to ensure thorough turbulent flow (Re>10,000) while minimizing operational costs.
•	Developed Interdisciplinary Skills: The internship report highlights a strong ability to integrate mechanical and chemical engineering principles, from understanding shaft power and impeller torque to performing thermofluid analysis for mixing systems.
•	Strengthened Computational and Analytical Skills: I gained hands-on experience with industry-relevant computational tools for reactor sizing, simulation, and cost estimation, solidifying the data-driven decision-making skills essential for a career in process engineering.
